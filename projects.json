The idea is to be able to reach a huge quantity of data in a 3D environment using a Golden Ratio longitude method for evenly distributed spheres, and a angled tree distribution for the branches, usign a natural gesture flow to move around and access the data. It can have uses in many big data applications, and I will test it in my new portfolio!",
